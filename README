Toy Robot
=========
This is a toy robot program which will move on a square table top. The table 
dimensions are 5x5. We can interact with the toy robot using the following 
commands

PLACE X,Y,F --> Place robot at X,Y, facing direction F
MOVE        --> Move one cell forward
LEFT        --> Rotate 90 degrees to the left 
RIGHT       --> Rotate 90 degrees to the right 
REPORT      --> Report the position and direction which robot is facing

F can be NORTH, SOUTH, EAST or WEST

Building Toy Robot and tests
============================
Makefile is provided to build executables. This was developed in a Linux 
environment, using gcc and Google test libraries for testing. All include files 
and lib files are provided in toy_robot folder

To build, make sure that Make and gcc is installed and run make in toy_robot 
folder

Two executables will be generated
toy_robot_runner : for running the console application
toy_robot_test : for running tests

Console application
===================
toy_robot_runner is the name of console application. It can be run with or 
without command line arguments. 
When run without command line arguments, a menu for interacting with the robot 
is provided.
When run with command line argument, a filename can me provided which contains 
a list of commands for interacting with the robot. The program will exit once 
all the commands in the input file is executed

C++ and Coding standards 
========================
C++17 standard is used
Google C++ Style Guide is followed while coding 
(https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html)
